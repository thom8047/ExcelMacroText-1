# ExcelMacroText-1
test for macro use in .xlsm extension

I currently can run one macro and it'll create a windows instand to find a defined variable within shell that represents the macro name. From this variable we can run the macro if the excel has a matching macro with the variable name.

Macro does not run when started.
